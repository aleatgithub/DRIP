# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)

# create main categories of sneakers (by style)
# put 10 sneakers in each category
# for each of those sneakers create 10 listings
# for each listing generate a price using min and max categories


#create a function that takes in a range of numbers and returns number to be used as a price for listings-number should be evenly
#divisible by five
